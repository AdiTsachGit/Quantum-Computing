Introduction to quantum computation
CS-308 / 5 credits

Teacher(s): Lévêque Olivier, Urbanke Rüdiger

Language: English

Summary

The course introduces the paradigm of quantum computation in an axiomatic way. We introduce the notion of quantum bit, gates, circuits and we treat the most important quantum algorithms. We also touch upon error correcting codes. This course is independent of COM-309.

Content

Introduction to quantum computation
- Classical circuit model, reversible computation.
- Quantum bits, Hilbert space of N qubits, unitary transformations, measurement postulate.
- Quantum circuit model, universal sets of gates.
- Deutsch and Josza's problem and algorithm.
Basic algorithms
- Hidden sub-group problem and Simon's algorithm
- Mathematical parenthesis: factoring integers and period of arithmetic functions. Notions on continued fraction expansions.
- Quantum Fourier transform and the period finding algorithm
